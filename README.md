# DataScience_Project--2
Case Study: Image Classification

Image Classification
In this project, you'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset
(https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other
objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples.
The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. You'll get to apply
what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the
end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.
